We replaced bespoke UI elements with **Nuxt UI V3** components to ensure better accessibility, consistency, and DX.

- Adopted `UApp`, `UContainer`, and `UTimeline`
- Tuned theme via `app.config.ts`
- Reduced custom CSS in favor of Tailwind utility classes

> This makes Logspot easier to maintain and theme.
